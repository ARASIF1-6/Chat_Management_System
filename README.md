Create a chat application with the specified requirements using a layered architecture for both frontend and backend. I'll break this down into multiple files and provide the complete structure.

First, let's set up the backend with Express.js, WebSockets, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL, following a layered architecture (controllers, services, models, routes).

Backend Structure:
1. controllers/: Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. services/: Business logic
3. models/: Database models
4. routes/: API routes
5. ws/: WebSocket logic
6. .env: Environment variables

Frontend Structure
1. public/: Static files (HTML, CSS)
2. server.js: Node.js server for frontend
3. styles/: CSS files
4. scripts/: JavaScript files
